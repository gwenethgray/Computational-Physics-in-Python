# Computational Physics in Python

This repository contains code snippets for an introductory course on Python programming with a focus on computational physics applications. It is intended for people with a beginner-level programming proficiency AND/OR people who know how to program but have limited physics education and would like to learn a new way to apply their skills. Learners are assumed to have some understanding of elementary calculus, trigonometry, and probability, as well as some familiarity with physics concepts such as the kinematic equations, conservation of momentum, radioactive decay, thermal equilibrium, and oscillation.

### Topics:
1. **Programming Review:** *Data, Functions, Objects, Libraries, Plotting, Complexity*
2. **Numerical Differentiation:** *Finite Difference, Euler's Method, Taylor Series*
3. **Kinematics:** *Free Fall, Drag, Parabolic Motion*
4. **Random Numbers:** *Congruential Generators, Non-Uniform Sampling, Monte Carlo Integration, Brownian Motion*
5. **Collisions:** *Hard Sphere Molecular Dynamics, Boundary Conditions, Animation, Heat Bath*
6. **Thermodynamics:** *Thermodynamic Average, Ising Model & Metropolis Algorithm, 1D Heat Equation*
7. **Oscillations:** *Simple Harmonic Motion, 1D Standing Waves, Harmonic Modes, Fourier Decomposition*
8. **Radiation:** *Exponential Attenuation, Compton Scattering, Bremsstrahlung*
